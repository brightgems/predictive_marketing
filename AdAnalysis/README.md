# AdAnalysis
Optimizing ads is one of the most intellectually challenging jobs a data scientist can do. It is a really complex problem given the huge (really really huge) size of the datasets as well as number of features that can be used. Moreover, companies often spend huge amounts of money in ads and a small ad optimization improvement can be worth millions of dollars for the company. The goal of this project is to look at a few ad campaigns and analyze their current performance as well as predict their future performance.
